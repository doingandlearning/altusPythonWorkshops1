# Introduction 
- Brief overview of Python libraries for functional programming
- Importance of these libraries for writing efficient and expressive code

# itertools library 
- Purpose: Provides a collection of efficient looping and iterator building functions
- Key functions:
	- itertools.groupby(): Group items in an iterable based on a key function
	- itertools.permutations(): Generate all possible permutations of a given iterable
	- itertools.combinations(): Generate all possible combinations of a given iterable
	- itertools.product(): Generate the Cartesian product of input iterables
- Code example:
```python
import itertools
    # Group data by a key function
data = [("apple", "fruit"), ("banana", "fruit"), ("carrot", "vegetable"), ("potato", "vegetable")]
for key, group in itertools.groupby(sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1]), key=lambda x: x[1]):
  print(f"{key}: {list(group)}")
```
- Points to talk about:
    - Itertools is a powerful and efficient library for working with iterators and loops
    - Functions in itertools can be combined to create complex iterator pipelines

# functools library (20 minutes)
- Purpose: Provides higher-order functions and other tools for working with functions
- Key functions:
- `functools.reduce()`: Apply a function cumulatively to the items of a given iterable, reducing the iterable to a single value 
- `functools.partial()`: Fix some arguments of a function, generating a new function with fewer arguments 
- f`unctools.lru_cache()`: Least Recently Used (LRU) cache decorator to optimize function calls with expensive computations
- Code example:
```python
import functools
    # Partially apply arguments to a function
    def greet(greeting, name):
        return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

    say_hello = functools.partial(greet, "Hello")
    print(say_hello("John"))  # Output: Hello, John!
```
- Points to talk about:
    - Functools provides higher-order functions and tools for function manipulation
    - Functions like `reduce()` and `partial()` can help create more expressive and reusable code

# operator library (10 minutes)
- Purpose: Provides a set of functions that correspond to Python's built-in operators
- Key functions:
	- operator.add(): Add two numbers
	- operator.mul(): Multiply two numbers
	- operator.itemgetter(): Retrieve an item from an object using the item's index or key
- Code example:
```python
import operator


# Using operator functions
result = operator.add(3, 4)
print(result)  # Output: 7
```
- Points to talk about:
    - Operator functions can be used in combination with higher-order functions for cleaner and more expressive code
    - Useful for scenarios where you need to pass an operator as an argument to another function (e.g., map(), reduce(), or filter())
    - Here are a few reasons why you might want to use the `operator` library instead of just using the built-in operators:
    1.  Function composition: The `operator` library allows us to compose multiple functions together, which can be useful when working with higher-order functions. For example, the `operator.add` function can be used to add two values together, and the `functools.reduce` function can be used to apply a function to a sequence of values. By composing these two functions, we can sum a sequence of values with a single line of code:

```python

import operator 
import functools  
values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
total = functools.reduce(operator.add, values) 
print(total)  # Output: 15
```


2.  Readability and clarity: By using the `operator` library, we can make our code more readable and clear, especially when working with complex expressions. For example, instead of writing `lambda x, y: x * y` to define a function that multiplies two values together, we can simply use the `operator.mul` function:


```python

import operator  
def multiply(a, b):     
  return operator.mul(a, b)
```


3.  Performance: In some cases, using the `operator` library can be more efficient than using the built-in operators. For examp****le, when working with large lists or arrays, the `operator.itemgetter` function can be used to extract specific items from each element in the list, which can be faster than using a lambda function or a list comprehension:


```python

import operator  
records = [     {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},     {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25},     {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}, ]  # Sort records by age 
sorted_records = sorted(records, key=operator.itemgetter('age'))
print(sorted_records)
```


Overall, the `operator` library can be a useful tool for writing more expressive, concise, and efficient code, especially when working with higher-order functions and complex expressions.

## Exercise: Use the itertools library to generate permutations of a given list (10 minutes)
- Task: Write a function that takes a list as input and returns all possible permutations of the list using the itertools.permutations() function
- Code example:
```python
import itertools

def list_permutations(input_list):
		return list(itertools.permutations(input_list))

sample_list = [1, 2, 3]
permutations = list_permutations(sample_list)
print(permutations)
```

    - Understanding the problem-solving strategy and how to use the itertools library
    - Identifying the appropriate itertools function to generate permutations
