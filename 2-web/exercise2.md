In this follow-up exercise, you will create a simple note-taking application that uses the same concepts from the Todo app. This will provide opportunities to practice the skills you've learned and extend them with additional features.

1. Create a Note class with the following attributes:

- id (integer)
- title (string)
- content (string)
- created_at (datetime)
- updated_at (datetime, optional)

2. Implement the following RESTful API endpoints for the Note app:

- GET /notes: Retrieve all notes.
- POST /notes: Create a new note.
- GET /notes/`<int:id>`: Retrieve a specific note by ID.
- PUT /notes/`<int:id>`: Update a note by ID.
- DELETE /notes/`<int:id>`: Delete a note by ID.

3. Add filtering capabilities to the GET /notes endpoint to allow users to search for notes by title or content.

4. Implement a simple pagination system for the GET /notes endpoint to limit the number of notes returned per request.

5. Add a timestamp feature to automatically update the updated_at attribute when a note is modified.

Here is a brief outline to get you started:

```python

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

class Note:
    # Add constructor and to_dict methods

notes = []

@app.get("/notes")
def get_notes():
    # Retrieve all notes with optional filtering

@app.post("/notes")
def create_note():
    # Create a new note

@app.get("/notes/<int:id>")
def get_note(id):
    # Retrieve a specific note by ID

@app.put("/notes/<int:id>")
def update_note(id):
    # Update a note by ID

@app.delete("/notes/<int:id>")
def delete_note(id):
    # Delete a note by ID

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```
By completing this exercise, you'll gain more experience working with Flask, handling HTTP requests, and building RESTful APIs. Additionally, you'll be able to extend the application with new features and functionality as desired.
